_A single fragment shader ([available here](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/live-coding/blob/main/3-Planet/3%20-%20Planet.frag)), rendered using [CoolLab](https://coollibs.github.io/lab/)_<br/>
_Made in collaboration with Enguerrand de Smet during a live coding session on the [E-Taverne](https://www.facebook.com/LaETaverne)_

We did put an emphasis on the rendering of the water. You can see reflections, refractions and light absorption.
