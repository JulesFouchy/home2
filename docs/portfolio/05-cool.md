title: Cool
---

With all the knowledge and code accumulated with my previous projects I decided to reify it all in a framework.<br/>
*Cool* is a C++ framework designed for computer graphics applications. It provides utilities like abstractions over OpenGL and Vulkan, camera classes, a history system, an image and video exporter, and many more!

**NB**: it is still a big work in progress! I expect to release a V1 around the end of 2022.
