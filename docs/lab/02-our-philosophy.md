By order of decreasing importance:

## Learn and create resources for others to learn

We are here to learn and share. As the name *Lab* suggests this is a place to make experiments and try out implementations.

By writing documentation and blog articles we strive to share our findings with others.

## Don't worry about what already exists

If you want to build something, go ahead!

While looking for inspiration, you will likely stumble upon people that have already done what you had in mind, perhaps even better. But if you let this stop you from starting your own version of this idea, you will never write a single line of code :(

Remember that we are here to learn and write code because we enjoy writing code. Don't let any other consideration stop you from doing what you want!

:::tip
It is when multiple people implement similar ideas that the best ones emerge. We can all learn from each other and anyone has a chance of finding clutch little details that improve the whole system.

## Visual Quality over Performance

We are not building a game engine ; even though performance is important because we wanna be able to visualize our changes in real time, visual quality is and should remain our main focus.

## Be cross-platform

Refuse any solution that would reduce accessibility to the software, especially when cross-platform solutions exist.

Examples of such technologies are Cuda (Nvidia only, can be replaced by Vulkan's compute shaders) and OpenGL 4.0 and greater (not suported on MacOS, can be replaced by Vulkan or WebGPU).

## Build an ecosystem of open source libraries

This is an occasion to work on *Cool* and put it to the test in a real-world project.
